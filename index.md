# RIT Women in Computing Active Membership Tracker - Senior Project 2024-25
## Project Synopsis

**RIT Women in Computing (WiC)** is an organization devoted to supporting and empowering women and gender minorities in the computing field. Throughout the year, WiC members attend a variety of meetings and events which contribute to their membership status. To track active membership, WiC uses numerous spreadsheets, which are completed manually throughout the year. This process is very time consuming, and will become more challenging to maintain as membership grows.

The WiC Active Membership Tracker is a web application that aims to automate this process and make membership status visible to members on demand. 
* Members will login with their RIT credentials to view their membership status, along with a detailed breakdown of all events they must attend in order to achieve active membership status. 
* An administrative portal will be available to the WiC Director and Logistics Head, allowing them to view the membership status of all members and generate reports from the available membership and attendance data. 
* Email updates will automatically be sent to members throughout the semester to inform them of their progress toward active membership status. 
* Future additions to this project may include the integration of the organization’s weekly member recognitions and alumni involvement. 

This application will be compatible with desktop and mobile browsers, and will support the accessibility needs of all users.
